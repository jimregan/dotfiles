\subsection{Apertium's text stream}

The various components of Apertium operate on two fundamental types of input:
tokens, and blanks. The first component of the Apertium pipeline serves to
normalise formatting details, by encapsulating them in so-called ``superblanks'':
that is, the formatting information is enclosed within square brackets, whose 
contents are treated by later components as though they were simple spaces.

As an example, the HTML fragment \texttt{the <b>third</b> man}, where ``third''
has been marked up with the HTML \texttt{<b>} element, to cause the text to
be rendered in boldface, would be ``deformatted'' by Apertium's HTML component
as \texttt{the[ <b>]third[<\/b> ]man}.

Tokens, the other fundamental type, can differ depending on the stage of pipeline.
The common elements of each type of token are the token boundary characters: \texttt{^}
to mark the start of the token, and \texttt{\$} to mark its end; and
