[p. 30, point 9]{christian1988new} ``common in form and genitive in function''.

One of the more difficult aspects of Irish grammar is the presence of two genitive constructs: one using the genitive case, most often used with the definite article, and the other using the common case with lenition. Many common placenames, including most of the names of counties, do not have a definite article, and are

A ``part'' of a ``clip'' in Apertium's transfer system refers to either one of a small number of pre-defined pieces, such as \texttt{lem} (containing the lemma), or \texttt{chcontent} (containing the content of a chunk), or to one of a set of user-defined attributes. These attributes are usually used to group morphological tags together categorically: for example, the attribute \texttt{num}, for number, is typically used to contain the values \texttt{sg} and \texttt{pl}, for singular and plural, respectively. These parts are filled using regular expression-based pattern matching on either the input string (referred to in the XML attribute \texttt{side} as the value \texttt{sl}, for source language), or on the result of looking up the token in the transfer lexicon (referred to with the value \texttt{tl}, for target language). One limitation of this system is that categories which are absent either from the input string, or the lexicon, cannot be referred to using the textit{clip} element, and must be inserted in other ways, typically either by using variables or by adding the tag with the \texttt{lit-tag} element.



Irish numbers have a count form, where the number follows the numerical particle ``a'': ``a haon'', ``a d\'o'', ``a tr\'i'', and so on. The count forms are usually identical to the normal cardinals, with two exceptions: ``d\'o'' is used for the number two, in place of ``dh\'a'', and numbers that begin with a vowel -- ``aon'' (\textit{one}), ``ocht'' (\textit{eight}), and ``ocht\'o'' (\textit{eighty}) -- are prefixed with the letter ``h''.

In the morphological analyser/generator for Irish, such forms are represented using the tag \texttt{hPref}, so to add this
