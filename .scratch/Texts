What is Apertium?

Apertium is a free/open-source machine translation platform, initially aimed at related-language pairs but recently expanded to deal with more divergent language pairs (such as English-Catalan). The platform provides

a language-independent machine translation engine
tools to manage the linguistic data necessary to build a machine translation system for a given language pair and
linguistic data for a growing number of language pairs.
Apertium uses a shallow-transfer machine translation engine which processes the input text in stages, as in an assembly line: de-formatting, morphological analysis, part-of-speech disambiguation, shallow structural transfer, lexical transfer, morphological generation, and re-formatting.

Apertium uses finite-state transducers for all lexical processing operations (morphological analysis and generation, lexical transfer), hidden Markov models for part-of-speech tagging, and multi-stage finite-state based chunking for structural transfer.

The initial design was largely based upon that of systems already developed by the Transducens group at the Universitat d'Alacant, such as interNOSTRUM (Spanish-Catalan, and Traductor Universia (Spanish-Portuguese).

It is possible to use Apertium to build machine translation systems for a variety of language pairs; to that end, Apertium uses simple XML-based standard formats to encode the linguistic data needed (either by hand or by converting existing data), which are compiled using the provided tools into the high-speed formats used by the engine.

Who is developing it?

The Apertium architecture is being developed by the Transducens research group at the Departament de Llenguatges i Sistemes Informàtics of the Universitat d'Alacant in collaboration with Prompsit Language Engineering.

Linguistic data for Apertium are being developed by Transducens and Prompsit

Spanish–Catalan
Spanish–Portuguese
Catalan–French
Occitan–Catalan
English–Catalan
the Seminario de Lingüística Informática of the Universidade de Vigo
Spanish–Galician
and the Institut Universitari de Lingüística Aplicada of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona
Occitan–Catalan
English–Catalan
French–Catalan
Many other developers are also generating new pairs. You can browse the SVN repository to see a snapshot of current development.

Apertium welcomes new developers: if you think you can improve the engine or the tools, or develop linguistic data for us, do not hesitate to contact us.

Funding

Apertium is one of the two open-source machine translation engines whose development started inside project OpenTrad (2004–2005); Apertium is designed to translate between related languages. The OpenTrad consortium was led by Eleka Ingeniaritza Linguistikoa.

The Opentrad project ("Open Source Machine Translation for the languages of Spain") was funded by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce of Spain through PROFIT grant numbers FIT340101-2004-0003 and FIT340001-2005-0002.

More recently, Apertium has also received funding from the Secretariat for Telecommunications and Information Society of the Generalitat de Catalunya (the government of the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain) to develop new language pairs and an improved architecture (Apertium 2.0) to include more difficult pairs such as English–Catalan, and again from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce of Spain through PROFIT grant number FIT350401-2006-05 (EurOpenTrad).

Project Trautorom ("Romanian-Spanish machine translation", package  apertium-es-ro) has been funded by: the Universitat d'Alacant through its Department of Computer Languages and Systems and the Office of the Vice-President for Extracurricular Activities (Vicerrectorado de Extensión Universitaria) and by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Parts of Apertium have also been funded by the Universitat d'Alacant.

NY police clear Occupy Wall Street camp

NEW YORK, N.Y. Police cleared New York’s Zuccotti Park early Tuesday so that sanitation crews could clean the site Occupy Wall Street protesters have inhabited for two months, while in Berkeley, Calif., activists planned another attempt at setting up a new camp.

Concerns about health and safety issues at Occupy Wall Street camps around the country have intensified, and protesters have been ordered to take down their shelters, adhere to curfews and relocate so that parks can be cleaned.

At about 1 a.m. Tuesday, New York City police handed out notices from Brookfield Office Properties, owner of Zuccotti Park, and the city saying that the park had to be cleared because it had become unsanitary and hazardous. Protesters were told they could return in several hours, but without sleeping bags, tarps or tents.

Minutes later, the mayor’s office tweeted that the protesters should “temporarily leave.”

Police in riot gear filled the streets, car lights flashing and sirens blaring. Protesters, some of whom shouted angrily at police, began marching to two locations in Lower Manhattan where they planned to hold rallies.

Paul Brown, a spokesman for the New York Police Department, said arrests had been made.

Some protesters refused to leave the park, but many left peacefully.

Ben Hamilton, 29, said he was arrested “and I was just trying to get away” from the fray.

Rabbi Chaim Gruber, an Occupy Wall Street member, said police officers were clearing the streets near Zuccotti Park.

“The police are forming a human shield, and are pushing everyone away,” he said.

Jake Rozak, another protester, said police “had their pepper spray out and were ready to use it.”

Notices given to the protesters said the park “poses an increasing health and fire safety hazard to those camped in the park, the city’s first responders and the surrounding community.”

It said that tents, sleeping bags and other items had to be removed because “the storage of these materials at this location is not allowed.” Anything left behind would be taken away, the notices said, giving an address at a sanitation department building where items could be picked up.

Alex Hall, 21, of Brooklyn, said police walked into the park “stepping on tents and ripping them out,”

The New York Times reported that the clearing out of Zuccotti Park came as protesters announced on their website that they planned to “shut down Wall Street” with a demonstration on Thursday to commemorate the completion of two months of the beginning of the encampment, which has spurred similar demonstrations across the country.

On Monday, a small group of demonstrators, including local residents and merchants, protested at City Hall. In recent weeks, they have urged the mayor to clear out the park because of its negative impact on the neighbourhood and small businesses.

Occupy encampments have come under fire around the country as local officials and residents have complained about possible health hazards and ongoing inhabitation of parks and other public spaces.

Anti-Wall Street activists intend to converge at the University of California, Berkeley on Tuesday for a day of protests and another attempt to set up an Occupy Cal camp, less than a week after police arrested dozens of protesters who tried to pitch tents on campus.

The Berkeley protesters will be joined by Occupy Oakland activists who said they would march to the UC campus in the afternoon. Police cleared the tent city in front of Oakland City Hall before dawn Monday and arrested more than 50 people amid complaints about safety, sanitation and drug use.

New Yorkeko Poliziak ehunka 'haserretu' bidali ditu Wall Streetetik

Kamioiak, helikopteroak eta ehunka agente erabili ditu. Protestagileek irailaren 17an okupatu zuten Zuccotti plaza.

Ia bi hilabete iraun dute haserretuek New Yorken (AEB) Wall Streeten zeukaten kanpalekuan. Gaur arte. Izan ere, hiriko Poliziak kanporatu egin ditu handik. Ehunka haserretu zeuden, eta guztiak atera ditu; gainera, hainbat atxiloketa egin ditu, Poliziak berak jakinarazi duenez.

NBC telebista kateak esan du 40 atxilotu egon direla. Poliziak ez du datu zehatzik eman. Haserretuek diote atzemandako bat Ydanis Rodriguez zinegotzia dela —"buruan zauri bat du, gainera".

Haserretuek irailaren 17an okupatu zuten Zuccotti plaza, gaur egungo sistemaren eta hau hartzen ari den neurrien aurka, "gizartean desberdintasunak areagotu" egiten dituelakoan.

Poliziak kamioiak, helikopteroak eta ehunka agente erabili ditu haiek Wall Streetetik bidaltzeko. Haserretuek esan du Poliziak, besteak beste, kanpalekuko liburutegia txikitu egin duela —jendeak utzitako laupabost mila liburu zeuden—

"Ez goaz, ez gara errenditzen", oihukatu dute haserretuek.

AEBetan joan den asteburuan 63 protestagile atzeman ditu Poliziak.

Now let us see what this western history was. In the middle of the ninth century Slav tribes of various denominations occupied the entire Baltic coast west of the Vistula; a line drawn from Lubeck to the Elbe, ascending the river to Magdeburg, thence to the western ridge of the Bohemian mountains, and passing on in a somewhat irregular course, leaving Carinthia and Styria on the east, gives the boundary between the Germans and the Slavs at that period. Very nearly in the centre of the territory north of Bohemia and the Carpathians lived one of a number of Slav tribes, the Polyane (or men of the plain), who occupied the region afterwards called Great Poland by the Poles, and now called South Prussia by the Germans. In this Great Poland political life among the Northwestern Slavs began in the second half of the ninth century. About the middle of the tenth, Mechislav (Mieczislaw), the ruler, received Christianity, and the modest title of Count of the German Empire. Boleslav the Brave, his son and successor, extended his territory to the upper Elbe, from which region its boundary line passed through or near Berlin, whence it followed the Oder to the sea. Before his death, in 1025, Boleslav wished to be anointed king by the Pope. The ceremony was denied him, therefore he had it performed by bishops at home. About a century later the western boundary was pushed forward by Boleslav Wry-mouth (1132-1139) to a point on the Baltic about half-way between Stettin and Lubeck. This was the greatest extension of Poland to the west. Between this line and the Elbe were Slav tribes; but the region had already become marken (marches) where the intrusive Germans were struggling for the lands and persons of the Slavs.
