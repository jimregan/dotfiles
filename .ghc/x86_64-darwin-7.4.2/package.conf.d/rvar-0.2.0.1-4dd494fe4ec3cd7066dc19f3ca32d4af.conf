synopsis: Random Variables
description: Random number generation based on modeling random
             variables by an abstract type ('RVar') which can be
             composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
             either monadic or \"pure\" styles.
             .
             The primary purpose of this library is to support
             defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
             random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
             but performance is an important goal too.
             .
             In my testing, I have found it capable of speed
             comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
             a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of
             the same algorithms.
             .
             Changes in 0.2.0.1:  Version bump for transformers
             dependency.
